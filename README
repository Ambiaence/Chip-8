The following is an implementation a chip 8 virtual machine.

It is in a debugging and refactoring state. Debug mode is used to test the implementation of the instruction set. SDL is used to handle I/O.

I am not using any reference outside of the specifications of chip-8 as to gain independence on these sorts of projects(Chip-8 is too small to look up any sort of tutorial), so do not look at this project for best practice. You won't find anything pedagogical here.
